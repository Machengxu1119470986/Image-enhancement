# low-light-image-enhancement
This is a Tensorflow implementation. We decompose the low illumination image into illumination map and reflection map. 
The idea of attention is added to the reflection part, so that when processing the reflection map, attention can be used where it needs to be enhanced more.
## Requirements ##
1. Python
2. Tensorflow 1.4.0
3. numpy, PIL
## Test ##
First download the pre-trained checkpoints from BaiduNetdisk https://pan.baidu.com/s/1d8gIj-qb6zx23KVDagQcJg ï¼Œand The extraction code is 1234,and just run
evaluate_LOLdataset.py
## Train ##
We train in LOLdataset,which can be found on the Internet.Save training pairs of LOL dataset under './LOLdataset/our485/' and save evaluating pairs under './LOLdataset/eval15/'. For training, just run
python decomposition_net_train.py
python adjustment_net_train.py
python reflectance_restoration_net_train.py
